# CakePHP demo app with the Assets Plugin

This is a very basic demo app with [brandcom/cakephp-assets](https://github.com/brandcom/cakephp-assets) installed.

Feel free to step through the commits to get a clear picture of what steps need to be taken to install and set up the plugin.

If you have questions or something is missing, feel free to open an issue on GitHub.

I am happy to provide more usage example.
